Dear (professor Shimeld),


As the Neptune Symposium approaches, we would like to share some information with you:

We have booked a room for you at the Hotel A.S. Lisboa (http://hotel-aslisboa.com/accommodation/). The Neptune ITN members will be also staying at this hotel, which is conveniently located near the subway, with direct access to the airport and the conference site.

We would kindly ask you to take care of your own travel arrangements. Our cap for travel reimbursement is 450 euros. The symposium will start on the 9th of November at 15h00 and finish on the afternoon of the 11th. Please let us know your flight details so that we can arrange the accommodation to best fit your travel plans.


To better arrange your reimbursement, please fill in the attached form. 

Finally, please let us know if you have any dietary requirements.


Sincerely,


(David Puga)
